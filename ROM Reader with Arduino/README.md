Commodore C128 ROM chip reader with Arduino Mega (Proof of concept) 

Using TinyGo on Arduino and Golang on Windows 10 PC (you may try on Linux or MAC- Tell me) 

Arduino Read ROM data and send to USB/Serial Port

Windows gets Serial port data, prints Hex dump to the console and saves a file in binary format.
